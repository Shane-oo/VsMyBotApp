<h4>Verse My Bot! In a Game of...<br /> The Resistance! </h4>
    <div class="desc">
        <p>
            The Resistance is a social deduction game with secret identities.
            Players are either members of the Resistance attempting to overthrow
            the government, or Spies trying to thwart the Resistance.
            The Resistance wins the game if three Missions are completed successfully;
            the Spies win if three Missions fail.The Resistance members have no information
            about anyone at the beginning of the game, while the Spies know who is or isn’t
            their fellow Spies. My goal for this project was to build a Resistant agent
            that uses rational choices and uses all the information gathered from the
            different stages of the game to predict who the Spies could potentially be leading
            to more victories for the Resistance over the Spies, reflecting similarities to
            how a real-life game would be played where players would go from what they’ve seen
            occur and then predict who they believe is the most likely be a Spy. The Agent
            developed was made with logical game playing policies and uses a Gaussian
            Naïve Bayes Classifier for its prediction.
