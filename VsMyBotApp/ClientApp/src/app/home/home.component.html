        <p>
            The Resistance is a social deduction game with secret identities.
            Players are either members of the Resistance attempting to overthrow
            the government, or Spies trying to thwart the Resistance.
            The Resistance wins the game if three Missions are completed successfully;
            the Spies win if three Missions fail.The Resistance members have no information
            about anyone at the beginning of the game, while the Spies know who is or isnâ€™t
            their fellow Spies.
